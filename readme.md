### Make Money on Your Site

Users can create and manage ads, upload images, receive emails about their listings and purchase credits. Classifieds is fully Multisite and BuddyPress compatible, meaning you can create a whole network of localized classifieds sites, similar to Craigslist. 

You can also enable the credit system and charge users for placing ads on your site. Thanks to the plugin's full PayPal integration, you set the prices and make money for each add posted on your site.
